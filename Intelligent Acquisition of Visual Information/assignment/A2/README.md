# Assignnent #3
- Single Camera Calibration with OpenCV
    - Your may use your own camera if its focal length can be fixed
- Recommend using a chessboard on a Pad/monitor
- Goals
    1. Finish intrisic and extrinsic calibration
    2. Discuss the impact of different factors (e.g., # of images, coverage of the chessboard, view angle. etc) over the final reprojection error.
    3. Output the estimated camera centers and the chessboard into a .ply file for 3D viewing in software like MeshLab
    4. Project some insteresting 3D points on the input images (i.e., augmented reality)
    5. [Bonus 15%] Make a real-time demo. You may want to fix the intrisic parameters and solve for the extrinsic ones only.
