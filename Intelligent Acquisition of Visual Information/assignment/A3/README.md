# Assignment #3: Passive Two-view Stereo
1. Perform stereo calibration with OpenCV sample
2. Compute a dense depth map / 3D point cloud from two calibrated input views via triangulation
    - Evaluate the impact of different parameters (e.g., patch size) over final quality
3. Resolve the color discrepancy between two views and produce the final colored 3D point cloud, along with the cameras, in a single .ply file
    - You may want to perform radimetric calibration first.
