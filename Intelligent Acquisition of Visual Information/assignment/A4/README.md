# Assignment #4: Projector-Camera-Based Setreo Vision
- Goal: Depth Measurement using Structred Lighting
- Approach #1: 2 Cameras + 1 Projector
    - Stereo calibration the two cameras
    - Project a pattern / a few patterns
    - Establish the correspondences between stereo calibrated cameras
    - Triangulate (Depth map & 3D point cloud)
- Approach #2: 1 Cameras + 1 Projector
    - Calibrate the camera-projector system
        - [reference](https://mesh.brown.edu/calibration/)
    - Project a pattern / a few patterns
    - Establish the correspondences between camera pixels and projector pixels
    - Triangulate (Depth map & 3D point cloud)
- Due Data: 11/01

- Sequential Patterns (==Pixel==-wise Comparison)
    - Gray Code
    - Phase Shift
    - Reference: High-Accurarcy Stereo Depth Maps Using Structured Light, Scharstein and Szeliski, CVPR 2003.
- Single-shot Pattern (==Patch==-wise Comparison)
    - Noisy Dot Patterns
        - What are good single-shot patterns?
