1. To build the project, you need to add the header files in the "header files" to the project, as well as the .c code "project1".
2. When running the program, you need to input the exponent N first. And then you will test the 3 algorithm respectively. In each test, you have to input the iteration number k (determine the number of loops the specific algorithm will run), then the total time (duration) will be shown in the console.
